# Penguine Patrol

Penguins Patrol is a thrilling arcade game that has the objective of rescuing penguins from being 
devoured by a shark. The game involves penguins that appear randomly and slide toward the 
shark's mouth. The player's responsibility is to tap on every penguin as it shows up. This will help 
players score points and prevent them from being eaten by the shark, which is hungry and always 
lurking nearby. The more penguin players save, the faster and more challenging the game becomes. 
This tests the playerâ€™s reflexes and accuracy. Be cautious though, since if the shark consumes 5 
penguins, the game will end. 

# Instruction to play

Save the penguins from being eaten by tapping on them before they slide into the shark's mouth. Each saved penguin earns you points. However, if five penguins slide into the shark's mouth without being saved, the game is over.
